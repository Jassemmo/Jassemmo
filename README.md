### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development & Web Mobile (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, MYSQL, NODEJS, EXPRESS, JAVA, SYMFONY, etc.).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all of these languages and learn more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: find me somewhere in France :) 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned Linux by myself using my first computer when i was 10 (in 2002) during a few months, but I didn't use it anymore until now.
